# School District Analysis

## Overview

### Background
While working with Maria to complete the School District Analysis, The school board has notified Maria and supervisor that the data file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, math and reading grades for Thomas High School. Mostly ninth graders appear to have been altered.
  
### Purpose
Purpose of this analysis is to replace the math and reading scores with NaN for ninth grade students who are studying in Thomas High School. And once it is done repeat the school district analysis.

Deliverables of this analysis are:

* Deliverable 1: Replace ninth-grade reading and math scores

* Deliverable 2: Repeat the school district analysis

* Deliverable 3: A written report for the school district analysis (README.md) 

## Result

* How is the district summary affected?
 
    The average math and reading score decreased by 0.1 points. The overall passing percentage also decreased by 0.2%.

* How does replacing the ninth graders math and reading scores affect Thomas High Schoolâ€™s performance relative to the other schools?

    Replacing the ninth graders math and reading scores by NaN has not affected the performance drastically. There is only slight difference in ovarall percentage which is negligible.


* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

	* Math and reading scores by grade
	    
      The only difference now between the scores is that under 9th graders who attended Thomas High School it shows an nan.

  * Scores by school spending
	
	   The score stays nearly same even though the 9th graders data is replaced as null.

  * Scores by school size
	
	  There is very slight change of 0.1 or 0.2 but rounded values shows no change. So replacing the 9th grade data does not affect drastically.
